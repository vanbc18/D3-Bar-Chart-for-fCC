# D3-Bar-Chart-for-fCC

A Bar Chart made with D3, it's my first Data Visualization project for freeCodeCamp.

It is a bar chart, showing gross domestic product between 1947 and 2015 in the US.
You can point to the year you want to know more about gross domestic product,
and a tooltip will appear next to your cursor and reveal all the informations you might need.

I learnt how to make an API call with d3.json().
